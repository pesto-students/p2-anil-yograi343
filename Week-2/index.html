                    <h2>What is One Piece?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>One Piece</b> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been
                        serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its
                        individual chapters compiled into 102 tankōbon volumes as of April 2022. The story follows the
                        adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after
                        unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy
                        explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D Roger's ultimate
                        treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.

                        The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by
                        Production I.G, and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in
                        Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one OVA and
                        thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising
                        and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed
                        for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in
                        Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an
                        English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and
                        subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.
